# <center> Dave to Dream Again

> 最早接触此篇文章在高中，当时花了两块钱买了本喜欢看的《英语沙龙》，当读第一遍的时候
就爱不释手并背了下来。在我今后的人生征途中，每每想到其铿锵有力的措辞，时刻迸发出掷地
有声的回响。实在是值得收藏与分享的枕边书，只不过要早起的时候看，开启激情燃烧的时刻。。。


#### Successful people always have a dream.They dream big dreams and then display great courage to do things that others say cannot be done.

Your dreams form the foundation of success.Many people have long forgotten the dreams they used to have when they were kids.
As they grow older,theyare simply too caught up with their work activities that they fail to discover 
what they really want to pursue in life.
They find themselves trapped in a routine work system that can potentially rob them of their dreams.

### To get you back to pursue your dreams,follow these step:

#### Learn to dream again: 
We are born to dream.Children often share their dreams and what they want to be when they grow up.
But we hear of teachers yelling in school:"Stop dreaming and pay attention in class!"
Parents,too,have shrieked:"Stop dreaming and get on with your homework!"
Learning and growing up in such an environment,one may regard dreaming as an unproductive act.
As children grow up,they are told to forget their dreams.and be practical because they are living in a "real" world.
In the end,many do g"realistic" and give up their dreams eventually.

#### Dream big dreams:
Never set mental boundaries on what you are capable of achieving.
Dreams are free anyway,so a long as you are dreaming,you might as well dream big.
Many people cannot realize their dreams and achieve greater success because they limit their own beliefs.

#### Free from dream killers:
Dream killers are devastating to your success.
Your friends,colleagues,and even loved ones can be one of your dream killers.
There are people who will try to distract,confuse,or persuade you to build the life they want,not the life that you want.
Stop listening to the people who tell you why you will not achieve your dreams.
You just need to believe you can do whatever it is you want to do.
Other people can only discourage us temporarily,but you are the only one who can prevent yourself 
from being discouraged premanently.
#### Stop giving excused:
Kids talk frequently about what they can do,whereas many adults do the opposite.
Adults tend to talk about what they cannot do and why.
You should stop giving reasons why you cannot achieve your dreams.
Many so-called reasons are merely excuses.If you continue giving excuses for not achieving, 
it will not take long before you convince yourself that you really cannot accomplish what you originally set out to achieve.
As Henry Ford wisely put it:"Whether you think you can or cannot,you're absolutely right."
#### Take action immediately:
Once you have big and clear dreams,take immediate action to work towards making them come true.
Very often,if people do not translate their intention into action soon,their passion will begin to diminish.
Weeks later,the passion will grow cold and months later,that passion may be gone forever.
#### Think about this:
Five birds are resting on the fence and minutes later;three birds decide to fly off to search for food.
How many birds are left on the fence?
Two?Wrong!There should still be five birds on the fence because deciding to fly off is not the same as the actual 
act of flying off.The birds would not be able to find food until they start to take action and fly
out of their comfort zone.
